# Weather_APA
openWeather api app

The code is notated throughout with simple explainations.  

The api keys for the opnWeather API and the Google Maps API are being openly used in this code.  I would not normally do this.  
I would store them according to the organization's security poicy for these keys.  At my current organization, keys are generally stored as environmental variables on the app server.
